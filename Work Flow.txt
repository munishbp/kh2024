Initial Assessment:

Connect to the helm box using the provided credentials.
Familiarize yourself with the current configuration of SSH and DNS services.


Secure SSH:
a. Update and patch:

Ensure your SSH server (likely OpenSSH) is up to date.
Apply any available security patches.

b. Configure SSH:

Locate and edit the SSH configuration file (typically sshd_config).
Disable root login: Set "PermitRootLogin no".
Use SSH protocol 2: Ensure "Protocol 2" is set.
Limit user access: Use "AllowUsers" to specify which users can connect via SSH.

c. Strengthen authentication:

Implement key-based authentication instead of passwords.
Generate SSH keys for authorized users.
Add public keys to the authorized_keys file for each user.

d. Adjust SSH settings:

Change the default SSH port from 22 to a non-standard port (e.g., 2222).
Limit login attempts: Set "MaxAuthTries 3".
Set idle timeout: Add "ClientAliveInterval 300" and "ClientAliveCountMax 3".

e. Firewall configuration:

Configure Windows Firewall to only allow SSH connections from trusted IP addresses.


Secure DNS:
a. Update and patch:

Ensure your DNS server software is up to date.
Apply any available security patches.

b. Configure DNS:

Verify that the required DNS record (sails.plinko.horse -> 172.16.t.20) is correctly set up.
Remove any unnecessary DNS records or zones.

c. Implement DNS security measures:

Enable DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to add authentication to DNS responses.
Configure DNS to use TCP instead of UDP for large responses to prevent amplification attacks.

d. Restrict zone transfers:

Allow zone transfers only to authorized secondary DNS servers.
Use ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict who can request zone transfers.

e. Implement query restrictions:

Configure the DNS server to only respond to queries from authorized clients.
Use ACLs to limit which IP addresses can make DNS queries.

f. Monitor DNS traffic:

Enable logging for DNS queries and responses.
Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.


General system hardening:

Disable unnecessary services and features.
Implement strong password policies.
Keep the system updated with the latest security patches.
Install and configure antivirus software.


Regular maintenance:

Schedule regular security audits.
Keep an eye on the scoreboard to ensure services remain operational.
Be prepared to revert changes if they cause issues with the scored services.


Documentation:

Document all changes made to configurations.
Keep notes on what worked and what didn't for future reference.


Continuous learning:

Stay informed about new security threats and best practices.
Be ready to adapt your security measures as the competition progresses.
